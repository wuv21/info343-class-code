We're\nin a modern world now and terminals support more than 16 colors so we are stupid\nto not take advantage of this.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install --save kuler\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nKuler provides a really low level API as we all have different opinions on how\nto build and write coloring libraries. To use it you first have to require it:\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n\nvar kuler = require('kuler');\n```\n\nThere are two different API's that you can use. A constructor based API which\nuses a `.style` method to color your text:\n\n```js\nvar str = kuler('foo').style('#FFF');\n```\n\nOr an alternate short version:\n\n```js\nvar str = kuler('foo', 'red');\n```\n\nThe color code sequence is automatically terminated at the end of the string so\nthe colors do no bleed to other pieces of text. So doing: \n\n```js\nconsole.log(kuler('red', 'red'), 'normal');\n```\n\nWill work without any issues.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n","maintainers":[{"name":"v1","email":"info@3rd-Eden.com"},{"name":"3rdeden","email":"npm@3rd-Eden.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-01-28T21:57:08.234Z","created":"2014-05-28T07:28:13.444Z","0.0.0":"2014-05-28T07:28:13.444Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/3rd-Eden/kuler","keywords":["kuler","ansi","color","colour","chalk","css","hex","rgb","rgv"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/3rd-Eden/kuler"},"author":{"name":"Arnout Kazemier"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/3rd-Eden/kuler/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"D5ESZTTTHCJ98GLG6TB3C23XF\""}
